Good Morning Everyone!

I just wanted to say how excited I am about the success of Sngglr. It's been a really fun journey.

Thank you everyone for putting up with the random glitches and breaks. Sngglr is becoming a more stable and safer dating website everyday and it's thanks to you guys.

Currently I'm in the process of spreading Sngglr to other schools. No idea if it'll sink or swim, but I think it has a good chance to actually become something, and you guys were the first.

If anyone has any questions or comments, please let me know. I'm always excited to hear how it's working out for other people.

Thanks Again,

Stuart Larsen
