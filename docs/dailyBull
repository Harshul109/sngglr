Do you have no social skills?
Do you kind of smell?
Is your life going downhill?

If you answered yes to some, one, of none of these, then you qualify for MTU/FUs dating website sngglr.com!

Sngglr is a dating website that can be used to find a partner for coffee, find a snggle buddy, set up a prostition ring, create a drug trafficking network, or for one night stands.

And besides, who wouldn't want to join a dating website where their mascot looks like a fat M&M had sex with a mouse.

I wanted to learn more about Sngglr, so I asked people what they thought:

What people are saying about Sngglr:
- "How did you get into my house?"
- "Do people actually use that website?"
- "I only snggle with the bronze blizzard"

But don't take their word for it, you can check it out here: sngglr.com

But in all srsness, it's free, open source, safer than tinder and shady parties, and made by MTU/FU for MTU/FU.
