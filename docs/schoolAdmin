Dear xxx,

Sorry for making fun of you on my last website.

That website was actually a dating website for MTU/FU students. Before I shut it down, it had 427 users, after only a little over a month.

Over the summer I worked pretty hard on creating a new version of the website, and I'm pretty excited on how it turned out. I think it has the potential to really grow. Which is why I'm going to start releasing to other schools besides just MTU and FU.

But in the meantime I'm still trying to make sure everything works perfectly on the MTU/FU campus.

The reason I'm emailing is to ask if MTU would be willing to support Sngglr. Not financially, more of with promotion and understanding.

I was wondering if you'd be able to check it out, from a campus administrative point of view, see if there's any potential problems with spreading to other schools. And if you'd be willing to mention it in one of your monthly emails.

Here's some reasons I think Sngglr is great:
- Open Source. It's open source, meaning anyone can see how it works, and even make their own version for free.
- Safe. You MUST use either a MTU or FU email address, meaning I know who every single user is incase a problem arose.
- Free. It's completely free, it doesn't even have ads. I built it with an extremely low operating cost.
- Safe Choices. It's a dating Website, not a hookup website (like Tinder). It promotes making better choices.

Let me know what you think!
