s# Sngglr, a history

Sngglr was never a serious project. It was actually a throw away project. I was trying a new framework (Firebase.io + AngularFire), and I thought it be funny to make Tinder. (I recently started using Tinder, and the idea seeme simple enough).

I sent it to some friends, with more of an emphesis on how awesome AngularFire. But they had fun matching with each other. So I worked on a little bit more and it spread quite a bit. I think I was around 50 people I decided maybe I should take the project a little bit more serious. So I rewrote it, but this time I actually wrote it using NodeJS/MongoDB, and a framework called Express.io (express+socket.io). It was a pretty cool app, but it was super real-time. You could watch as people typed up their status. It was pretty neat.

But the realtime stuff was kind of getting in the way, it broke a lot so I gave up. So, a few months later I wrote the most current version. I make it more normal, so standard MEAN stack. MongoDB/Express/Anuglar/NodeJS. And everything is happy. Yeay. <300 users.
